Datascope: Unveiling How AI Uses Your Data
Datascope is a simple and powerful web application that allows users to check how websites track their data. By analyzing websites for cookies, tracking scripts, and behavioral data, Datascope helps you understand what data is being gathered and how it might be used.

This project is aimed at raising awareness about data privacy, helping users make informed decisions about their digital footprint.

Project Overview
Mission: To provide transparency on how websites collect and use personal data, allowing users to understand, control, and manage their privacy.
Tech Stack:
Backend: Flask (Python)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Data Analysis: Python libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup
Hosting: Heroku (for deployment)
Features
Data Tracking Detection: Paste any URL into the app, and the tool will check for common tracking mechanisms such as:
Cookies
Google Analytics
Facebook Pixel
Other third-party tracking scripts
User-friendly Interface: Provides a simple and clean interface to view data tracking results.
Explanation Section: Explains the types of data being collected and how it may be used.
Blocking Recommendations: Suggests ways to block or opt-out of tracking.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
Install Python (preferably Python 3.7 or higher).

Install Flask using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask
Install necessary libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
Steps to Run Locally
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/datascope.git
cd datascope
Set up your project:

Place your project files (app.py, index.html, styles.css, etc.) in the project directory.
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the app in action.

Deployment
Deploying on Heroku
Install the Heroku CLI from here.

Create a Heroku app:

bash
Copy code
heroku create datascope
Push your code to Heroku:

bash
Copy code
git push heroku master
Visit your site at https://datascope.herokuapp.com.

Usage
Go to the homepage: Once the app is deployed, users can simply paste any website URL into the form.
Results: The app will fetch the page and analyze it for tracking scripts. Results will show if common trackers like Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel are used.
Explanation: The app will explain the purpose of each tracker and how the data may be used (e.g., ads targeting, website optimization).
Blocking: The app will suggest ways to block or manage your data privacy, such as using browser extensions like ad-blockers or privacy tools.
